              <p>
                The UIU Mars Rover Team (UMRT) project was launched as a
                student-driven initiative at United International University
                (UIU) to compete in the University Rover Challenge (URC) and
                other international robotics competitions. It began with a
                group of passionate engineering and robotics enthusiasts
                working under the guidance of faculty members from UIU's
                Engineering and CSE departments. Through continuous innovation
                in mechanical design, AI-based vision, autonomous navigation,
                and robotic arms, the team rapidly gained recognition. United
                International University started to fund the UIU Mars Rover
                Team for further Developement.
